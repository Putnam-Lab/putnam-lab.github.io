Putnam Lab - University of Rhode Island

# #OpenForScience

We believe the scientific endeavor is best served by transparent and reproducible work. We participate in open science and share not only outcomes but process.

Our notebooks and code document thoughts, analyses, knowledge gains, roadblocks, detours, and products. Our goal is to facilitate scientific advancement through the open sharing of data and analytical approaches. As with science, these resources are a work in progress hopefully advancing with every iteration.
