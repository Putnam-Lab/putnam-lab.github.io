Protocol for the extraction of total RNA for use in QPCR and Next Generation Sequencing. Yeilds total RNA that has been DNAse treated and is ready for downstream applications.

#RiboPure RNA Purification Kit (RiboPure Kit, ThermoFisher, Catalog # AM1924)  
* [RiboPure Manufacturer's Instructions]({{ https://hputnam.github.io}}/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/protocols/RiboPure_fm_1924.pdf)  
* "The Ambion RiboPure Kit is designed for rapid purification of high-quality RNA from tissue samples or cultured cells. The kit combines TRI Reagent with glass fiber filter purification to yield exceptionally pure RNA, free of residual proteins and lipids."

- used DNase I from DirectZol kit

## Protocol for Isolation of Total RNA
 
### Homogenization and Phase Separation Steps
* Add 1ml of TRI Reagent for 50-100mg of tissue in sterile RNAse DNAse free microfuge tube 
* Homogenize tissue and TRI Reagent mix with teflon microfuge pestle
* Add 0.2ml of chloroform per 1ml of RNAzol 
* Vortex for 15sec and let sit at room temperature for 5min 
* Centrifuge samples at 12,000g for 10min at 4°C
	* _Centrifugation at temperatures >8°C may cause some DNA to partition in the aqueous phase_
* Remove supernatant into a new RNAse DNAse free microfuge tube 

### Filter Binding, Washing, and DNase Treatment
* Add half the volume of 100% ethanol to the supernatant from the step above and mix thoroughly (e.g. 400µl of supernatant plus 200µl of EtOH)
* Vortex immediately to avoid RNA precipitation
* Transfer mixture to Filter Cartrigde in collection tube
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 30sec
* Discard flow through 
* Add 0.5ml **Wash Solution** to the column (**add EtOH to solution concentration prior to use**)
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 30sec and discard flow through

*On Column DNAse Treatment*
* _Mix 75µl of DNA Digestion Buffer with 5µl of DNase I (6U/µl)_ from Directzol RNA mini prep 
* _Incubate at room temperature for 15min_

* Add 0.5ml **Wash Solution** to the column 
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 30sec and discard flow through
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 30sec to dry column
* Transfer the column to a new RNAse DNAse free microfuge tube
* Elute RNA by adding up to 100µl of DNAse/RNase-Free water directly to the column
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 30sec
* Aliquot RNA into multiple tubes for downstream applications
