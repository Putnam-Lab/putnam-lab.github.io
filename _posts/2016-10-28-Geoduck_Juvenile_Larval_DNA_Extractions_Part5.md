 * Had a lot of difficulty concentrating #1 and #78 to remove liquid before extraction. Sample 78 consumed, sample 1 available at -20. 

## DNA Extractions 

 * added ~40mg of tissue to 180µl of Buffer ATL and 20µl of Proteinase K  
 * for samples 65 and 66 there was so much material used 4x the buffer and protK
 * took 1 180µl aliquot forward into extraction and saved rest of EPI-65 and EPI-66 in ATL buffer at room temp
 * Also saved EPI-36 and EPI-38 pellets in new 180µl of ATL buffer at room temp
 
 * Proceeded with [DNA Extraction Protocol](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/DNA-Extraction-Protocol/)
 * Did not do the RNase treatment
 * Eluted in 150µl of AE Buffer
 * Saved samples at -80°C in 2 aliquots (6µl for gel and Qubit,~140µl)

## DNA Quantification 20161028
 * Used 2µl of sample and 198µl of Qubit Mix
 * Ran Qubit dsDNA BR [DNA Quantification Protocol](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit_BR_DNA_Protocol/)

 * a 140µl aliquot with an average of ~35ng/µl has ~4.9µg of DNA
 
 
## DNA Quality 20161028
Ran a quality check of DNA using a 1% TAE gel in 10x TAE running buffer

** Accidentally used 10x TAE, which resulted in gel running very slowly

## Gel Preparation
1X TAE  

* 40 mM Tris (pH 7.6) 
* 20 mM acetic acid
* 1 mM EDTA

**_Accidentally used 10x TAE, which resulted in gel running very slowly_**


## Samples

## Gel Bottom  

* O Gene Ruler Mix SM 1173 Thermo Fisher 0.1µg/µl Range 100–10,000 bp

 * EPI-78
* O Gene Ruler Mix SM 1173 Thermo Fisher 0.1µg/µl Range 100–10,000 bp

## Gel Setup

* Added 1.5g of Agarose to 150ml of 10X TAE and heated until clear
* Added 12µl of Ethidium Bromide to gel
* Poured gel with 16 upper wells and 16 lower wells
* Once gel was set, Added 4µl of 6x loading dye to each sample of 4µl of DNA (6x purple loading dye #B70245 New Endland BioLabs) and added 8µl of mix to each well
* Ran gel at 100v for 60 minutes

## Conclusions  
* Samples are more difficult to see then on actual gel
* Appears to be some large band >10,000 bp and some smear below
* Most samples have high molecular weight DNA present
* Some are too low of concentration to see (EPI-1, EPI-65)
* EPI-78 appears to only be very small degraded fragments
* EPI-36 and EPI-38 appear to have degradation in comparison to EPI-10

* Will continue to move forward with DNeasy [**DNA Extraction Protocol**](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/DNA-Extraction-Protocol/)
