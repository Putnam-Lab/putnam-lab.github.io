Homogenization of juvenile geoduck samples for use in nucleic acid extractions

Processed samples saved in RNA later and those saved at -80 by grinding the tissues to a powder as described.

## Sample list 20160912
Homogenization method was changed to crushing with metal pestle in plastic tube to minimize loss of tissue homogenate on the side of the mortar due to the small size of the samples

* EPI-41
* EPI-42
* EPI-43
* EPI-44
* EPI-45
* EPI-46
* EPI-47
* EPI-48
* EPI-49
* EPI-50
* EPI-51

* EPI-53
* EPI-54
* EPI-55
* EPI-56
* EPI-103
* EPI-104
* EPI-111
* EPI-113

* EPI-309-Siphon The tip of siphon was cut off and homogenized so that I can test the RNA extraction in the absence of gut content. 
* EPI-309-Body The remainder was homogenized and put in a different tube to give a mix of siphon and body tissues.


## Conclusions
* All samples for initial library prep are homogenized. 
* There should be more then enough tissue in each tube for multiple RNA or DNA extractions, with the exception of the earliest stage samples. 
* I will test RNA quality from a -80 stored sample [See sample list]({{ https://hputnam.github.io}}/project_juvenile_geoduck_OA/Setup_Notes/Sample_List.csv)
* I will test RNA quality from the siphon only sample (309 siphon above) and the siphon plus body sample (309 body)

* Tests of different samples will identify if noisy peaks in prior extractions are due to gut contents or degradation.
