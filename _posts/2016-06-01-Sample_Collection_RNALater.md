## RNALater Guidelines
[RNALater]({{ https://hputnam.github.io}}/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/protocols/RNALater_7020M.pdf)  

* Use RNA later Solution with fresh tissue only; do not freeze tissues before immersion in RNAlater Solution. 
* Before immersion in RNAlater Solution, cut large tissue samples to 
≤0.5 cm in any single dimension. 
* Place the fresh tissue in 5–10 volumes of RNAlater Solution. 
* Most samples in RNAlater Solution can be stored at room temperature for 1 week without compromising RNA quality, or at –20° C or –80° C indefinitely. 
* Do not freeze samples in RNAlater Solution immediately; store at 4° C overnight (to allow the solution to thoroughly penetrate the tissue).
* For storage at -20 keep the sample in RNALater.  
* For storage at -80 remove RNALater, then move tissue to –80° C for long-term storage.  


# Sample Collection  

## Tool Sterilzation
* Make 10% bleach solution in DI water in plastic beaker labeled ```#1 10% Bleach```
* Pour 100% DI water in plastic beaker labeled ```#2 DI Water```
* Pour 100% Ethanol soluion in plastic beaker labeled ```#3 100% Ethanol```
* Line up Beakers 1, 2, and 3 next to the ethanol burner filled with 100% ethanol

* First, dip the clippers and forceps in ```#1 10% Bleach```
* Second, rinse clippers and forceps in ```#2 DI Water```
* Third, rinse the clippers and forceps in ```#3 100% Ethanol```
* Fourth, sterilze tools by burning off the ethanol 
* Fifth, place tools upside down in tube rack with sterile end up

## Glove Sterilzation
* Make a 5 gallon bucket with 10% bleach
* Make a 5 gallon bucket with fresh water 
* Dunk gloved hands in 10% bleach and then fresh water bucket between each sample

## Sample Collection

* Fill each tube with 1.5ml of RNALater solution
* Pick up sample with clean glove
* Cut tissue section ≤0.5 cm in any single dimension
* Place tissue section in prelabeled 2ml tube with 1.5ml of RNAlater
* Repeat sample collection process for a duplicate tube for every sample as possible

## Sample Preservation

* store samples in RNALater at 4° C for 24-48h (to allow the solution to thoroughly penetrate the tissue)
* remove liquid and move samples to –20° C or –80° C for long-term storage
