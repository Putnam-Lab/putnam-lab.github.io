Protocol for checking the quality of RNA.
Provides RNA integrity number and microgel to assess degradation and DNA contamination.

## RNA 6000 Pico Kit (RNA 6000 Pico Kit, Agilent, Catalog # 5067-1513)
* [Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Pico Kit  Kit Manufacturer's Instructions]({{ https://hputnam.github.io}}/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/protocols/G2938-90046_RNA600Pico_KG_EN.pdf)
* The Bioanalyzer provides "Quantitation and integrity analysis of total RNA or mRNA, RNA Integrity Number (RIN) – to compare integrity of total RNA samples, and Visualization of rRNA impurities in mRNA samples"

## Protocol for Quantification of RNA
* **_Heat denature samples at 70°C for 2min and place on ice immediately prior to use_**
* Qualitative range 50–5000 pg/μl for Total RNA, and 250–5000 pg/μl mRNA

## Procedure
* Follow Manufacturer's Instructions exactly
