Objective:Test quantity and quality of RNA extracted from fresh coral samples of 3 species (Montipora capitata, Porites compressa, and Pocillopora damicornis). This protocol includes a purification column which has not been used in the previous extractions and should increase quality.


## Protocol: Hybrid Trizol (Invitrogen 15596018) and Direct-zol kit protocol  (Zymo cat R2050)


Required Reagents and Expendables:
    Trizol (Invitrogen 15596018)
    100% chloroform (molecular grade)
    70% EtOH (molecular grade)
    RNAse free water (DEPC-treated water)
    RNA purification kit - Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research Cat: R2050)
    RNase DNase free tubes with beads or garnets (MoBio 13123-50)
    bead beater or Tissuelyzer (Qiagen 85300)
    bench centrifuge at 4C (at least 12,000 x g)
    bench centrifuge at Room Temp (at least 12,000 x g)
    quick spin down centrifuge
    vortex
    Pipettes - P1000, P200, P10

## Protocol Steps:
_**Complete these steps 1-12 in a hood**_

1. add 1.0mL of Trizol in the 2mL garnet tubes

2. bead beat 2mL garnet tubes with Trizol (Qiagen TissueLyzer frequency 1/s=30, time = 1min)

3. incubate at RT for 5 min, hand mix several times

4. spin down tubes using bench quick spin

5. add 214µl of 100% chloroform and hand-shake for 15 sec

6. incubate at room temperature for 3 min

7. centrifuge at 12,000x g for 15 min at 4°C

8. pipette out only the clear supernatant above the white interphase (volume should be ~500-600µl). add supernatant to a new RNase, DNase free 1.5mL tube

9. add another 214µL of 100% chloroform to the garnet tube with sample and trizol and hand-shake for 15 sec

10. incubate at room temperature for 3 min

11. centrifuge at 12,000x g for 15 min at 4°C



    ### prepare your DNAse mix 

* for each reaction mix 5µl of DNase I (6U/µl) with 75µl of DNA Digestion Buffer (from Direct-zol kit R2050 Zymo)
* Only mix enough for each day. Save on ice until use.




12. pipette out clear supernatant (~200uL) into the RNase, DNase free 1.5mL tube from step 8 (DO NOT disrupt the interphase)

    _**Complete the following steps in the RNA prep area**_

13. add 500uL of 70% Ethanol to the tube from steps 8 and 12, vortex for 3 sec and quick spin down

14. pipette 500uL of RNA sample Ethanol mix onto the Direct-zol spin column

15. centrifuge at 12,000x g for 15 sec at 4°C and discard the flow through

16. pipette the remaining ~500uL of RNA sample and Ethanol mix onto the Direct-zol spin column

17. centrifuge at 12,000x g for 15 sec at 4°C and discard the flow through

18. add 400 μl Direct-zol RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge

19. centrifuge at 12,000x g for 15 sec at 4°C and discard the flow through

20. add 80µL of DNAse mix directly onto column and incubate at room temperature for 15 min

21. Add 400 μl Direct-zol RNA PreWash to the column

22. centrifuge at 12,000x g for 15 sec at 4°C and discard the flow through

23. Add 400 μl Direct-zol RNA PreWash to the column
 
24. centrifuge at 12,000x g for 15 sec at 4°C and discard the flow through

25. transfer column onto new collection tube

26. add 700µL of Direct-zol RNA Wash Buffer onto column

27. centrifuge at 12,000x g for 2 minutes at 4°C and discard the flow through

28. transfer column onto a new RNase, DNase free 1.5mL tube

29. add 50µL of Direct-zol RNAse free water directly onto the column

30. incubate at room temperature for 1 min

31. centrifuge at 12,000x g for 2 minutes at 4°C and save the RNA

32. aliquot 3µL of RNA sample in 200µl PCR tube for Nanodrop quantification

33. aliquot 3µL of RNA sample in 200µl PCR tube for Bioanalyzer integrity check

34. place RNA aliquot for nanodrop on ice and measure immediately.

35. store RNA samples and bioanalyzer aliquots in -80C freezer

Samples were assessed on a ND-100

#### 260/280 Description Nanodrop
"The ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm is used to assess the purity of DNA and RNA. A ratio of ~1.8 is generally accepted as “pure” for DNA; a ratio of ~2.0 is generally accepted as “pure” for RNA. If the ratio is appreciably lower in either case, it may indicate the presence of protein, phenol or other contaminants that absorb strongly at or near 280 nm."


_260/230 Description Nanodrop
"This ratio is used as a secondary measure of nucleic acid purity. The 260/230 values for “pure” nucleic acid are often higher than the respective 260/280 values. Expected 260/230 values are commonly in the range of 2.0-2.2. If the ratio is appreciably lower than expected, it may indicate the presence of contaminants which absorb at 230 nm."_

##### Summary: 
Montipora capitata and Pocillopora damicornis were extracted successfully. Porites compressa did not extract well. The majority of the RNA is being eluted in the first elution from the column. There is no need to do 2 elutions. This is a viable protocol for Montipora capitata and Pocillopora damicornis, but requires trouble shooting for Porites compressa.

_Shinzato et al 2014 has demonstrated successful RNA extraction from Porites using a Qiagen kit. We have the Qiagen all prep kit in stock and will repeat the same species extractions as a comparison._
