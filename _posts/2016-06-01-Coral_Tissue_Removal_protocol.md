# Equipment
**Equipment listed below are examples of what I have used and other brands can be substituted**  
  
* [Whirlpaks](https://www.enasco.com/whirlpak/)
* [Airbrush](http://www.iwata-medea.com/products/)
* [Sample Tubes](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/falcon-50ml-conical-centrifuge-tubes-2/p-193321)
* Ziplock Bags
* Tweezers


# Procedure
* Clean and steralize all equipment and use sterile tubes and bags
* Add filtered seawater to the airbrush 
* Place coral into sterile bag
* Use air and liqid to remove tissue which forms a slurry in the bag
* **Take care** to avoid back splash from the airbrush, which could cause loss of the tissue 
* Rinse coral skeleton with filtered seawater
* Cut corner from bag and drain into sterile tube
* Rinse bag to collect any remaining tissue
* Save coral for surface area estimation
* Record tissue homogenate volume and store tube or use in further assays
