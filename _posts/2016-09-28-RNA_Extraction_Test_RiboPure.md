Tested RNA extractions using Ambion RiboPure Kit
Protocol [**RNA Extraction Protocol RiboPure Kit**](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/RNA-Extraction-Protocol-RiboPure/)


## Sample list used for comparisons with Directzol Kit
* EPI-309 S-309 = siphon tissue only stored in RNAlater, ground to powder on liquid nitrogen on 20160912, and stored at -80
* EPI-309 M-309 = whole body and some siphon tissue stored in RNAlater, ground to powder on liquid nitrogen on 20160912, and stored at -80 
* Geoduck10 G-10 (tissue from Grace) = adult tissue stored at -80 and extracted immediately after removal from freezer
* EPI-56 = whole body stored at -80, ground to powder on liquid nitrogen on 20160912, and stored at -80
* EPI-103 = whole body tissue stored in RNAlater, ground to powder on liquid nitrogen on 20160912, and stored at -80
* EPI-303
* EPI-302
* EPI-299
* EPI-298
* EPI-290
* EPI-289

## Extraction Procedure
* Used ~10mg plastic scoops to transfer 2-4 scoops (~40mg) of ground tissue to 0.5ml TRI Reagent
* Homogenized again with teflon pestles in microfuge tubes with TRI Reagent
* Proceeded with [**RNA Extraction Protocol RiboPure Kit**](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/RNA-Extraction-Protocol-RiboPure/)
* After initial centrifugation, yielded ~0.3ml of supernatant that was mixed with 0.15ml of 100% ethanol and was added to the spin column step

## RNA Quantification 
* Diluted samples 1:50 in nucelase-free water
* Used 10µl of sample and 190µl of Qubit Mix
* Ran [**RNA Quantification Protocol**](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit_HS_RNA_Protocol/)
* Saved samples at -80°C in 2 aliquots (~35µl each)

 ---|---|---|---
 EPI-303 | 9.84 | 10 | 98.4 
 EPI-303 | 0.87 | 100 |87.0 
 Stnd2 | 10 | 1 | 10 
 EPI-M-309 | 1.81 | 50 | 90.5 
 EPI-S-309 | 1.19 | 50 | 59.5

 EPI-289 | 0.548 | 50 | 27.4 
 Geo-10 | 5.26 | 1 | 5.26 
 EPI-56 | 12.9 | 1 | 12.9 
 EPI-103 | 0 | 1 | 0 



## RNA Quality check of total RNA
* Ran [**RNA Quality Check Protocol**](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Bioanalyzer_Euk_Total_RNA_Pico_Protocol/)

* Used 1:50 dilution from Qubit above and ran on bioanalyzer
* [BioAnalyzer 20160928 Chip]({{ https://hputnam.github.io}}/project_juvenile_geoduck_OA/Sample_Processing/Gels/2100expert_Eukaryote_Total_RNA_Pico_DE72902486_2016-09-28_15-34-44.pdf)

## Conclusions
* There is not a substantial increase in RNA quality between the Directzol kit and the RiboPure Kit. 
* There still appears to be degradation in some samples. 
* Will proceed by extracting all homogenized samples with the Directzol protocol and check quality
* If extracted samples are of poor quality will consider proceeding with siphon only tissue.
