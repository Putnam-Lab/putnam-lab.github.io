Protocol for the quantification of genomic DNA.
Provides DNA sample concentration

## Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit, ThermoFisher, Catalog # Q32850)
* [Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit Manufacturer's Instructions]({{ https://hputnam.github.io}}/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/protocols/Qubit_dsDNA_BR_Assay_UG.pdf)
* "The Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit is designed specifically for use with the Qubit Fluorometer. The assay is highly selective for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) over RNA and is designed to be accurate for initial sample concentration from 100 pg/µl–1,000 ng/µl."

## Protocol for Quantification of DNA
* **_Use only thin-wall, clear, 0.5-mL PCR tubes. Acceptable tubes include Qubit assay tubes (Catalog # Q32856) or Axygen PCR-05-C tubes (Catalog # 10011-830)._**
* **_If approximate sample concentration is unknown prior to measurement, run a dilution series with 1-2 samples to bring concentration within range of the assay (e.g., 1:1, 1:10, and 1:100)_**
* **_record any dilutions done prior to measurement in order to back calculate original concentration_**
 
## Procedure

* Label tubes for each of your samples and 2 standards (Label lids only!)
  * Broad Range (standard 1 = 0 ng/μL DNA in TE buffer, standard 2 = 100 ng/μL DNA in TE buffer)  
* Prepare the Qubit working solution by diluting the Qubit dsDNA BR Reagent 1:200 in Qubit dsDNA BR Buffer (Volume = #samples + #standards + 1 extra)
  * The final volume in each tube must be 200 μL
  * Each standard tube requires 190 μL of Qubit working solution, and each sample tube requires anywhere from 180–199 μL
  * Prepare sufficient Qubit working solution to accommodate all standards and samples
* Add 190μL of working solution to each of the tubes used for standards
* Add 10μL of each standard to the appropriate tube, then mix by vortexing for 2–3 seconds (Take care NOT to create bubbles)
* Add Xµl of working solution to individual assay tubes so that the final volume in each tube after adding sample is 200 μL (no less than 180µl)
* Add 200µl - Xµl of sample to each tube, then mix by vortexing for 2–3 seconds (Take care NOT to create bubbles)
* Incubate tubes at room temperature for 2min (cover with foil)
* Read standards on Qubit
* Set volume of sample and readout in ng/µl and read each tube
