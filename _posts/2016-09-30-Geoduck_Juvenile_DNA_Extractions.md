Extracted DNA from Juvenile Geoduck Tissue previously homogenized using the [**Sample Homogenization Protocol**](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Homogenization-N2-protocol/)

## Sample list    
* EPI-167
* EPI-168 
* EPI-175
* EPI-176
* EPI-187
* EPI-188
* EPI-205
* EPI-206
* EPI-220
* EPI-221
* EPI-229
* EPI-230   

## DNA Extractions 
* added ~20mg of tissue to 180µl of Buffer ATL and 20µl of Proteinase K
* Proceeded with [**DNA Extraction Protocol**](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/DNA-Extraction-Protocol/)
* Did not do the RNase treatment
* Eluted in 200µl of AE Buffer

## DNA Quantification 
* Used 1µl of sample and 199µl of Qubit Mix
* Ran Qubit dsDNA BR [**DNA Quantification Protocol**](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit_BR_DNA_Protocol/)
* Saved samples at -80°C in 2 aliquots (6µl,~190µl)

## DNA Concentrations  

**Sample.ID** | **Qubit Conc(ng/µl)** | **Dilution** | **Initial Conc(ng/µl)**
 ---|---|---|---
 EPI-230 | 10.1 | 1 | 10.1 
 EPI-229 | 17.4 | 1 |17.4 
 EPI-221 | 30.0 | 1 | 30.0 
 EPI-220 | 48.8 | 1 | 48.8 
 EPI-206 | 18.1 | 1 | 18.1 
 EPI-205 | 11.9 | 1 | 11.9 
 EPI-188 | 14.5 | 1 | 14.5 
 EPI-187 | 17.1 | 1 | 17.1 
 EPI-176 | 7.8 | 1 | 7.8 
 EPI-175 | 19.6 | 1 | 19.6 
 EPI-168 | 6.2 | 1 | 6.2 
 EPI-167 | 13.2 | 1 | 13.2
 
* a 190µl aliquot with an average of ~17.5ng/µl has ~3µg of DNA
* need to run gel quality check of DNA

## DNA Quality 20161003
Ran a quality check of DNA using a 1% TAE gel in 1x TAE running buffer

### Gel Preparation
TAE  

* 40 mM Tris (pH 7.6) 
* 20 mM acetic acid
* 1 mM EDTA

## Samples  
  
###Gel 1  

* O Gene Ruler Mix SM 1173 Thermo Fisher 0.1µg/µl Range 100–10,000 bp
* Test 1
* Test 2
* EPI-167
* EPI-168 
* EPI-175
* EPI-176
* EPI-187
* EPI-188
* EPI-205
* EPI-206
* O Gene Ruler Mix SM 1173 Thermo Fisher 0.1µg/µl Range 100–10,000 bp

###Gel 2  

* O Gene Ruler Mix SM 1173 Thermo Fisher 0.1µg/µl Range 100–10,000 bp
* EPI-220
* EPI-221
* EPI-229
* EPI-230 
* O Gene Ruler Mix SM 1173 Thermo Fisher 0.1µg/µl Range 100–10,000 bp

## Gel Setup

* Added 0.75g of Agarose to 75ml of TAE and heated until clear
* Added 6µl of Ethidium Bromide to gel
* Poured gel with 12 upper wells and 8 lower wells
* Once gel was set, Added 6µl of 6x loading dye to each sample of 6µl of DNA (6x purple loading dye #B70245 New Endland BioLabs)
* Added 5µl of the sample-loading dye mix to each well
* Ran gel at 100v for 45 minutes

**Gel 2**  

![Gel 2](https://github.com/hputnam/project_juvenile_geoduck_OA/blob/master/Sample_Processing/Gels/20161003_DNA_Gel_2.jpeg?raw=true)

## Conclusions  
* Samples are more difficult to see in Gel 1
* Appears to be large band >10,000 bp and some smear below
* Samples in Gel 2 are more clear and appear to have relatively discrete bands with minimial smear
* The data from Gel 2 suggest a good quality DNA extraction with minimial DNA degradation or contamination  

* Will move forward with DNeasy [**DNA Extraction Protocol**](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/DNA-Extraction-Protocol/)
