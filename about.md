I am an integrative marine eco-physiologist. I strive to understand how the immediate abiotic environment and biotic interactions drive organism phenotype,  ecological patterning, and evolutionary processess through the interaction of symbiosis, genetics, and epigenetics. 

I am dedicated to open, rigorous, and reproducible experiments and analyses.
